                    <h4> Millenium Tower </h4>
                    <p> Even though the Millenium Tower explodes every other day, the sick ass fights that happen make it all worth it. You might even get a nice helicopter ride with our one and only Date-san! Fun fact: I don't know how they repair it so nicely every single time. </p>

                    <h4> Pocket Circuit Racing </h4>
                    <p> Believe me, it is not a "only for kids" thing. Things here are taken seriously, by kids and men. You might beat some little dude that will certainly call you a virgin but at the same time find you cool because of your skills - if you even have any. </p>

                    <h4> The Coliseum </h4>
                    <p> The crown of the Purgatory! Opened after the disgraced former police detective known as The Florist of Sai went underground to become a private information dealer. You can see some cool fights, but not like in every other corner of Kamurocho. Here the stakes are higher and even you can participate for a certain fee. </p>
